Detailed explanation
Main Window:

A custom Tkinter window (CTk) is created with a light blue background, a title, and a fixed size (non-resizable).
Background Image:

A background image (bg1.jpg) is loaded and displayed in the window using a CTkLabel.
Login Frame:

A frame (CTkFrame) is placed in the window containing all the login-related elements. The frame has a rounded, light beige background.
Widgets:

Title Label: Displays a welcome message at the top of the frame.
Username and Password Fields: Two entry fields (CTkEntry) are provided for the user to enter their username and password, with styling for rounded corners and placeholder text.
Create Account Link: A clickable label that suggests creating a new account.
Login Button: A button labeled "Login" positioned at the bottom-right, styled with rounded corners and a teal color.
Grid Layout:

The widgets are organized using a grid layout, with padding and alignment to structure them neatly within the window.
Main Loop:

The main.mainloop() starts the Tkinter event loop, making the GUI interactive and keeping it open until the user closes the window.
The result is a stylized login screen with a background image and interactive elements for user authentication.
